/**
 * pm2 process definitions for the VPS — kept in lockstep with the CURRENT
 * repo layout: the Next.js app lives at the repo ROOT (the old `web/`
 * subdirectory no longer exists), the MCP bridge lives in `mcp/`, and the
 * chart-host runs as a Docker container (see chart-host/README.md), not
 * under pm2.
 *
 * The previous revision of this file predated that layout: it pointed cwd at
 * ./web, launched mcp through a script that sourced the missing web/.env, and
 * capped processes at 512M while the live definitions run 1G — so any
 * `pm2 start/restart` from the file broke all three processes.
 *
 * Secrets are NOT in this file: web and worker read $ROOT/.env through
 * @next/env at boot, and infra/aichart-mcp.sh loads the same file before
 * exec'ing `node mcp/dist/index.js` (rebuilding dist first when sources are
 * newer — see the incident note inside the script).
 *
 * Every app execs its real binary DIRECTLY rather than going through `npm
 * run`. Under npm, the pid pm2 tracks is the npm shell: killing it (a
 * `kill -9`, an OOM kill, a segfault) left the actual node process alive and
 * still holding the worker's health port, so every restart died on
 * EADDRINUSE and the restart counter climbed past a hundred with nothing to
 * show for it. The process pm2 reports must be the process that holds the
 * resources.
