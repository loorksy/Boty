/**
 * Execution is MANUAL-ONLY — the revived layer's constitution, structurally.
 *
 * The owner deliberately revived a narrow execution layer (linked MT5 via
 * MetaAPI, one market order per explicit human press). What must now stay
 * true forever is not "no execution exists" but something sharper:
 *
 *   1. the ANALYSIS cannot reach the order path — no agent loop, resident
 *      tool, scheduler, sweep, or scan imports the execution modules;
 *   2. the decision contract still cannot express an order — a plan carries
 *      no volume, no lots, no "execute now";
 *   3. execution never writes the recommendation record — the agent is
 *      graded on its plans, not on what anyone executed;
 *   4. the MCP surface carries exactly the sanctioned manual pair, keeps
 *      every auto/approval-shaped tool dead, and no analysis tool steers
 *      the model toward executing;
 *   5. the execution routes authenticate a HUMAN (session or bridge user) —
 *      there is no service path that fires an order.
 *
 * A failure here is not style. It means an order could happen with nobody
 * pressing anything.
