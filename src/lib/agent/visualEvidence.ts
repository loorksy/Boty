/**
 * Chart images for the decision engine.
 *
 * The MCP agent has always looked at real charts while the platform's engine
 * read a JSON summary of the same market. Two ways of seeing produce two
 * answers, and the whole premise is one mind on both surfaces — so this fetches
 * the same multi-timeframe capture the MCP tool uses and hands it to the
 * decision call in the same interleaved form.
 *
 * Best-effort by contract. TradingView's client screenshot is the ONLY
 * accepted image source — the operator's own tab when one is polling, else
 * the platform's shared chart session (chart-host container), whose page
 * runs the same takeClientScreenshot. Unattended runs (Telegram, cron,
 * worker) therefore get REAL charts whenever the chart session is up; when
 * neither tab exists there is still NO image — no rendered substitute, no
 * stored snapshot — the frames are reported missing and the analysis
 * proceeds on numbers alone, publishing normally. A missing view degrades
 * the read rather than killing the analysis.
 *
 * The degradation is only honest if it is STATED. This module returns what was
 * requested alongside what arrived, so "I did not see the 4h" reaches the model
 * as a fact rather than as an absence it would have to infer — an inference it
 * cannot make, since nothing else tells it which frames were ever asked for.

/**
 * Capture the frames in the process that can actually answer.
 *
 * The chart-host rendezvous is module state: `platformPending` (where a
 * capture request waits to be collected) and `platformTabAt` (what
 * `hasFreshPlatformTab` reads) both live in memory in `chart/liveCapture.ts`,
 * and only the HTTP route `/api/chart/host-capture` writes to them. That route
 * is served by the WEB process — but an analysis runs in the WORKER, reached
 * through the Redis turn queue. Two Node processes, two private copies of that
 * map and that timestamp.
 *
 * So a capture requested by an analysis was filed in the worker's map, the
 * container polled the web process whose map was empty, the request was never
 * collected, and the worker's tab timestamp was never touched — leaving
 * `hasFreshPlatformTab()` permanently false, `ensureChartHostTab` burning its
 * full 25s warmup, and every frame returning `capture_timeout`. Every
 * analysis said "no chart snapshot was available" while the very same capture through
 * MCP — which reaches the app over the bridge, i.e. the web process — took
 * 6.2s and returned three real TradingView frames.
 *
 * The rule is therefore capability, not identity: if THIS process holds a
 * live tab, capture here. If it does not, hand the work to the process that
 * serves the app, which is where the tab is. No recursion is possible — the
 * route calls `captureMultiTimeframeSnapshot` directly, never this function.
