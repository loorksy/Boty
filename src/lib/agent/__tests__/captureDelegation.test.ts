/**
 * Where a chart frame is captured, when this process cannot capture it.
 *
 * The rendezvous the chart-host container polls is module state — a Map and a
 * timestamp living in `chart/liveCapture.ts`. Only `/api/chart/host-capture`
 * writes to them, and that route is served by the WEB process, while a
 * platform analysis runs in the WORKER behind the Redis turn queue. Two Node
 * processes hold two private copies, so a capture the worker filed was never
 * the one the container collected: every frame timed out, every analysis
 * reported "no chart snapshot", and the identical capture through MCP — which
 * lands on web — returned three real frames in 6.2s.
 *
 * These tests exist because the fix FAILS SILENTLY by design: every unhappy
 * path falls back to a local capture that returns an empty-but-valid result.
 * A regression here does not throw and does not log an error — it just quietly
 * goes blind again, which is exactly the symptom that took this long to find.
 * So each branch is pinned by name.
