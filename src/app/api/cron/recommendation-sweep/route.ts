/**
 * Scheduled recommendation-tracker sweep. Evaluates every non-terminal tracked
 * recommendation against fresh CLOSED candles from OANDA — the warehouse this
 * once named is gone — persists status/outcome changes, and tells the operator
 * what actually changed. Runs with NO browser session and NO LLM, and it cannot
 * execute anything: this platform issues recommendations and places no orders.
 *
 * Set RECOMMENDATION_ALERTS_SILENT=1 to record events without delivering them —
 * the first rollout window, so the real message volume on a live book can be
 * measured before anyone's phone starts buzzing.
 *
 * Auth: the platform cron secret (Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET> or the
 * `x-cron-secret` header). Overlap-safe via a distributed lease lock. Idempotent
 * and a safe no-op when no recommendations are active.
 *
 * Schedule it with any external scheduler (Vercel cron, a platform cron job, or
 * `curl` from a systemd timer) hitting POST with the cron secret.
